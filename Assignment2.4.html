    <h2> The Box Model</h2>
    <p>  Every element you place on a page creates a box. You cannot always see the boundaries and the borders of the boxes you create, but the boxes are there. A div element creates a box, as do h1,img, span, and td elements. Each box has properties you can set with CSS. I've illustrated some of these properties in Figure 1.</p>
    <h3>figure 1 Border, margin and padding </h3>
    <p> The padding of a box is the distance between the content of the box and the box's border, and the margin is the distance between a box and any adjacent element. In other words, padding adds space inside the border, while a margin adds space outside the border. In the following CSS, I set both the padding and the margin to a distance of 10 pixels. This is why you can see so much white space in Figure 1.</p>
    <p>The border surrounding every element is not visible by default, but by using CSS I can change the color of an element's border, as well as the thickness and line style the browser uses when drawing the border. What you see in Figure 1 is the result of a style rule telling the browser to draw a solid, thin, red line around the box that each div element creates.</p>
